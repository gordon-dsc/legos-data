We acquired data about Lego sets and themes through the API from rebrickable.com.
We needed to make two GET requests since there was no data frame on rebrickable
that contained both set and theme data. However, the set data and theme data both
contained a column labeled theme_id, which was the same in both data frames.
Using theme_id, we joined the sets data to the themes data to create a data set
which gave us the theme (e.g. Spider-Man or Star Wars) corresponding to a
particular Lego set.
