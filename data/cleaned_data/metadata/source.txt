After importing our sets/themes data from API and franchise data from web scraping,
we joined the two datasets togther for our final dateset. First, we had to combine
common Lego set themes together. For example, "The Simpsons Series 1" and "The
Simpsons Series 2" were combined into a common theme labeled "The Simpsons". Next, we
changed the themes in the franchise data to match similar names to the Lego set 
data. Lastly, we were able to join the two data sets together by the themes column. 
This final dataset, lego_franchise_csv, contains information about Lego sets including
the release year and the number of parts as well as information on the associated
media franchise with inception date, original medium, and total revenue.
